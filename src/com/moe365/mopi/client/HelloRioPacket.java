 * A {@link RioPacket} basically for handshaking with the Rio.
 * The main purpose of this packet is that, if <code>stronghold-pi</code> is restarted, it's packet
 * ids will restart from 0 (expected behavior), but any devices listening to the UDP packets that it
 * emits will keep dropping packets until the id of the packets emitted by the current instance of
 * stronghold-pi 'catches up' with the previous one.
